# Campus Connect

**Campus Connect** is a social platform designed for college students, providing a space for juniors, seniors, and faculty to interact. Built using Ionic and Angular for the front-end and the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack for the back-end, it offers features such as authentication, one-to-one chatting, user profiles, community forums with nested commenting, and an in-built notification system.
